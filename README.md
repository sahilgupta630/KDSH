## 🏆 Project Overview

This project was developed as a solution for the **Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon (KDSH) 2026** Challenge.

The goal of this system is to automatically validate the consistency of character backstories against a provided corpus of books. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, the system decomposes complex backstories into atomic claims, retrieves relevant evidence from the source texts, and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to verify whether the claims are supported, contradicted, or not mentioned in the text.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern AI/NLP stack:

*   **🐍 Python**: The core programming language.
*   **🚅 Pathway**: A high-performance data processing framework used for efficient document ingestion and handling live data streams.
*   **🧠 SentenceTransformers**: Used for generating semantic embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to capture the meaning of text chunks.
*   **⚡ Groq API**: Powers the high-speed inference for the LLM (Llama 3 / Mixtral) used in reasoning and verification.
*   **🔍 Cross-Encoder**: Utilized for precise re-ranking of retrieved evidence to ensure the most relevant context is sent to the LLM.
*   **🐼 Pandas**: Employed for structured data manipulation and results tracking.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Code.ipynb` | 📓 Original Jupyter Notebook used for initial development and experiments. |
| `data_ingestion.py` | 📥 Handles loading books and creating vector embeddings using **Pathway**. |
| `query_generator.py` | 🧩 Uses an LLM to decompose backstories into verifiable atomic claims and search queries. |
| `evidence_retrieval.py` | 🔎 Retrieves and re-ranks evidence chunks from the book corpus. |
| `verification.py` | ⚖️ The "Judge" - verifies claims against retrieved evidence using the LLM. |
| `validator.py` | ⚙️ Orchestrates the entire pipeline, processing the dataset and generating `results.csv`. |
| `Dataset/` | 📁 Contains `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and the `Books/` directory. |

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- A Groq API Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sahilgupta630/KDSH.git
    cd KDSH
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Pipeline

You can run the full validation pipeline using the `validator.py` script (or by importing it).

```python
import os
from groq import Groq
from data_ingestion import NovelIngestionPipeline
from validator import run_validation

# 1. Setup Client
client = Groq(api_key="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY")

# 2. Ingest Data (Books)
pipeline = NovelIngestionPipeline("Dataset/Books")
index_df = pipeline.run_indexing()

# 3. Run Validation
results = run_validation(client, "llama3-70b-8192", index_df, limit=10)
print(results)
```
